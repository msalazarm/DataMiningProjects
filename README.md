# DataMiningProjects
A small selection of my personal Data Mining Projects

In the CovidDataMining folder I have some code I made to scape Google to find out approximately how many mentions of the terms Covid, Coronavirus, and Pandemic occured each day. I was using this to correlate Stock prices.
a.html is an example of what one of those pages would look like before it is scraped.

In the DataProcessing folder, I have an example of one of the times where I scraped all of the Game Data off of the Steam Video Game store, and processed it to do sentiment analysis, and Price point analysis.
I was planning to release a game, so I was trying to find out what would be a fair and profitable price point.
I included the Scraped file, and a shortened version (so that it wouldn't be 100MB) of the output.

Altogether these projects show familiartity with Data Mining and Data Processing in a Python3 enviornment.
